Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - parameter nbits
 - input  in_ (nbits)
 - output out (log2(nbits))

The module should implement an N-to-M encoder. The input is a one-hot
signal (i.e., exactly one bit is one) and the output is a binary encoded
value indicating the index of the input bit which is set to one. The
input is nbits wide and the output is log2(nbits) wide. If the input is
an invalid one-hot encoding then the output should be zero.
