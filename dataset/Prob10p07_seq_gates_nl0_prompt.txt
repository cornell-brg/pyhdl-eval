Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - output out

The module should implement the following circuit: input in0 should be
connected to a D flip-flop; input in1 should be connected to a separate D
flip-flop; the outputs of both D flip-flops should be connected to the
inputs of a two-input AND gate. The output of the AND gate should be
connected to the output port. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.
