Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - parameter nbits
 - input  in_ (nbits)
 - output out

The module should implement a NOR gate that is parameterized by the
number of inputs to the logic gate.
