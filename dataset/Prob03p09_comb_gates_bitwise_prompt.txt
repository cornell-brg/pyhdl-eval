Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0      (4 bits)
 - input  in1      (4 bits)
 - output out_and  (4 bits)
 - output out_nand (4 bits)
 - output out_or   (4 bits)
 - output out_nor  (4 bits)

The module should implement a total of 16 logic gates. It should
implement four two-input AND gates that calculate the bitwise AND of the
two inputs and connect the output of these four AND gates to the four
bits of the out_and output port. It should similarly calculate the
bitwise NAND, OR, and NOR and connect the outputs to the appropriate
output port.
