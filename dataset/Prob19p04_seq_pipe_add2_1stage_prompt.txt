Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in0 (8 bits)
 - input  in1 (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement a one-stage pipelined two-input adder. All
transactions should have a one cycle latency (i.e., inputs on cycle i
will produce the corresponding sum on cycle i+1). Here is an example
execution trace. An X indicates that the output is undefined because
there is no reset signal for the pipeline registers.

   cycle | in0 in1 out
  -------+-------------
     0   | 00  00  XX
     1   | 01  01  00
     2   | 02  03  02
     3   | 03  04  05
     4   | 00  00  07

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.
