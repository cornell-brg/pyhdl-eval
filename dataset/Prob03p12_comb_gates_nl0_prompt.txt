Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - output out

The module should implement the following circuit: inputs in0 and in1
should be connected to a two-input XOR gate; the output of the XOR gate
should be conneectd to a NOT gate; the output of the NOT gate should be
connected to the first input of a two-input AND gate; input in2 should be
connected to the second input of the two-input AND gate; the output of
the AND gate should be connected to the output port.
