Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0  (8 bits)
 - input  in1  (8 bits)
 - input  in2  (8 bits)
 - input  in3  (8 bits)
 - output out0 (8 bits)
 - output out1 (8 bits)
 - output out2 (8 bits)
 - output out3 (8 bits)

The module should implement a sorter unit which writes the smallest input
value to out0, the second smallest input value to out1, and so on. Assume
all values are encoded as unsigned binary numbers.
