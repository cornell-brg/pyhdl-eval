Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (array of four ports, each port is 2 bits)
 - output out (array of four ports, each port is 2 bits)

The module implementation should directly connect each the input port to
the corresponding output port. So input port in[0] should be connected to
output port out[0], input port in[1] should be connected to output port
out[1], and so on.
