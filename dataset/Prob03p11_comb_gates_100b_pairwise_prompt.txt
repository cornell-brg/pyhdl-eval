Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_      (100 bits)
 - output out_and  ( 99 bits)
 - output out_or   ( 99 bits)
 - output out_xnor ( 99 bits)

The module should use a variety of logic gates to analyze consecutive
pairs of bits of the 100-bit input: use 99 AND gates to determine if a
given input bit and its neighbor are both one; use 99 OR gates to
determine if either the given input bit or its neighbor are one; and use
99 XNOR gates to determine if a given input bit and its neighbor are
the same. The outputs of these gates should be connected to the
appropriate output port. Logic gates analyzing bits 0 and 1 of the input
should be connected to bit 0 of the output port, logic gates analyzing
bits 1 and 2 of the input should be connected to bit 1 of the output
port, and so on.
