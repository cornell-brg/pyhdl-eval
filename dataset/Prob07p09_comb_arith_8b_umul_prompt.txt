Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0 ( 8 bits)
 - input  in1 ( 8 bits)
 - output out (16 bits)

The module should implement an unsigned multiplier which multiplies the
two given inputs and writes the result to the output. Assume all values
are encoded as unsigned binary numbers.
