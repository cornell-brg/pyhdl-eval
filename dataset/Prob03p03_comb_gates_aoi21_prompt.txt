Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - output out

The module should implement a 2-1 AND-OR-inverting (AOI) compound gate.
Inputs in0 and in1 should connect to the AND gate and input in2 should
connect to the remaining input of the OR gate.
