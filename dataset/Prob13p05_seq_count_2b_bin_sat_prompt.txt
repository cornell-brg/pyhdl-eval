Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  en
 - input  op
 - output out (2 bits)

The module should implement a 2-bit binary up/down saturating counter
with an active-high synchronous reset. The counter should be reset to two
when the reset input is one. The counter should then count either up or
down by one every cycle as long as the input en is one; when the counter
reaches either zero or the maximum value it should saturate (i.e,
continue to hold the current value and not wrap-around). The input op
specifies whether to count up or down using the following encoding:

 - 0 : count up
 - 1 : count down

The internal counter register should be directly connected to the output
port. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.
