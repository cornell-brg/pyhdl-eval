Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_  (4 bits)
 - input  sel  (3 bits)
 - output out0 (4 bits)
 - output out1 (4 bits)
 - output out2 (4 bits)
 - output out3 (4 bits)
 - output out4 (4 bits)
 - output out5 (4 bits)
 - output out6 (4 bits)
 - output out7 (4 bits)

The module should implement a 4-bit 1-to-8 demultiplexer. The input sel
should select which of the outputs is written with the value of the input
port in_. Unselected output ports should be set to all zeros. If sel
equals 0 then out0 should be selected, if sel equals 1 then then out1
should be selected, and so on.
