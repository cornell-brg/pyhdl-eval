Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  state      (2 bits)
 - input  in_
 - output state_next (2 bits)
 - output out0
 - output out1

The module should implement the state transition and output logic for the
Moore finite-state machine (FSM) described by the following table.

   Current | Next State  Next State | Output  Output
   State   | if in_=0    if in_=1   |   0       1
  ---------+------------------------+----------------
      A    |     A           B      |   0       0
      B    |     C           B      |   0       1
      C    |     A           D      |   0       1
      D    |     C           B      |   1       0

The state machine should use the following state encoding.

 - A : 0
 - B : 1
 - C : 2
 - D : 3

The module should only implement the combinational state transition logic
and output logic and should not include any sequential state.
