Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in_
 - output state (2 bits)
 - output out

The module should implement a Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) with four
states. The FSM will be described as a set of FSM transitions with each
transition specified using the following format.

  X (0) --1--> Y

In this example, the FSM transitions from state X to state Y when the
input is 1 and the output of the FSM should be 0 during this transition.
Implement the FSM with the following transitions.

  A (0) --0--> A
  A (1) --1--> B
  B (1) --0--> C
  B (0) --1--> B
  C (0) --0--> A
  C (1) --1--> D
  D (0) --0--> C
  D (0) --1--> B

The state machine should use the following state encoding.

 - A : 0
 - B : 1
 - C : 2
 - D : 3

The FSM should reset to state A when the reset input is one. The internal
state register should be directly connected to the output port state so
that this output always reflects the current state of the FSM. Assume all
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
