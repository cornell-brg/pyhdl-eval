Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - parameter nbits
 - input  in_ (nbits)
 - output out (nbits)

The module implementation should connect the input port to the output
port but with the bits in reversed order. The module is pararmeterized by
bitwidth of each port (nbits). In other words, in_[0] should be connected
to out[nbits-1], in_[1] should be connected to out[nbits-2], and so on.
