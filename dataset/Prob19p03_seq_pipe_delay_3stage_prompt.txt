Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement a three-stage pipelined channel where the
input data is passed unchanged through three stages of pipeline
registers. Here is an example execution trace. An X indicates that the
output is undefined because there is no reset signal for the pipeline
registers.

   cycle | in_ out
  -------+---------
     0   | 00  XX
     1   | 0a  XX
     2   | 0b  XX
     3   | 0c  00
     4   | 0d  0a
     5   | 0e  0b
     6   | 0f  0c
     7   | 00  0d
     8   | 00  0e
     9   | 00  0f

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.
