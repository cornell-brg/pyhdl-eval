Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  ld
 - input  in_ (3 bits)
 - output out (3 bits)
 - output done

The module should implement a 3-bit binary down counter. When the input
ld is high, then the input (in_) should be loaded into the counter. The
counter should then count down by one every cycle; when the counter
reaches zero it stop counting and remain at zero until a new value is
loaded into the counter. The internal counter register should be directly
connected to the output port. The output done should be (combinationally)
set to one when the counter is zero. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
