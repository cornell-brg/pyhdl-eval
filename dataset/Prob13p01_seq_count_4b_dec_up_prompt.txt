Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output out (3 bits)

The module should implement a 3-bit binary up counter with an active-high
synchronous reset. The counter should be reset to zero when the reset
input is one. The counter should then count up by one every cycle; when
the counter reaches the maximum value it should wrap-around. The internal
counter register should be directly connected to the output port. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
