Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - parameter nbits
 - input  in_ (nbits)
 - output out (log2(nbits))

The module should implement an N-to-M priority encoder. The output is a
binary encoded value indicating the index of the input bit which is set
to one. If more than one bit of the input is set to one, then the module
should choose the "highest priority" bit (i.e., the bit with the lowest
index). The input is nbits wide and the output is log2(nbits) wide. If no
bits are set in the input, then the output should be zero.
