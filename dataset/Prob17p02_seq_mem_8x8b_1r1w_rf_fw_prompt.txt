Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  read_addr  (3 bits)
 - output read_data  (8 bits)
 - input  write_en
 - input  write_addr (3 bits)
 - input  write_data (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-entry 8-bit register file with one read
port and one write port. The read port should be combinational (i.e., the
read data corresponds to the input read address on that cycle) and writes
should only occur when the write enable is high. If the write enable is
high and write address and the read address are equal, then the read data
should be combinationally set to the write data (i.e., the data should be
forwarded from the write port to the read port). Assume all sequential
logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
