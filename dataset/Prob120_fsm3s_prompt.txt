I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a Moore state machine with the following
state transition table with one input, one output, and four states.
Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

  State | Next state in=0, Next state in=1 | Output
  A     | A, B                             | 0
  B     | C, B                             | 0
  C     | A, D                             | 0
  D     | C, B                             | 1

The module includes an active-high synchronous reset signal; this means
the reset is sampled with respect to the clock, so do not include posedge
reset in the sensitivity list of any sequential always block. The reset
signal should reset the FSM to the A state.
