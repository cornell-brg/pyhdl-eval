Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output out (4 bits)

The module should implement a single-digit decade up counter with an
active-high synchronous reset. The counter should be reset to zero when
the reset input is one. The counter should then count up by one every
cycle; when the counter reaches nine it should wrap-around. The internal
counter register should be directly connected to the output port. Assume
all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
