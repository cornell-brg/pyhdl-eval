Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (32 bits)

The module implementation should connect the input port to the output
port using sign extension. Sign extension involves taking the
most-significant bit of the input and replicating it to fill the
most-significant bits of the output.
