Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (4 bits)
 - output out (2 bits)

The module should implement a 4-to-2 encoder. The input is a one-hot
signal (i.e., exactly one bit is one) and the output is a binary encoded
value indicating the index of the input bit which is set to one. If the
input is an invalid one-hot encoding then the output should be zero.
