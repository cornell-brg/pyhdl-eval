Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - parameter nbits
 - input  in_ (log2(bits))
 - output out (nbits)

The module should implement an M-to-N decoder. The output is a one-hot
signal (i.e., exactly one bit is one) and the input is a binary encoded
value indicating which bit of the output should be set to one. The output
is nbits wide and the input is log2(nbits) wide. If nbits is not a power
of two, then it might be possible for the input to be too large for the
given number of bits in the output; in this situation set the output to
be zero.
