Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (4  bits)
 - output out (16 bits)

The module should implement a 4-to-16 decoder. The output is a one-hot
signal (i.e., exactly one bit is one) and the input is a binary encoded
value indicating which bit of the output should be set to one.
