Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0 (8 bits)
 - input  in1 (8 bits)
 - output min (8 bits)
 - output max (8 bits)

The module should implement a min/max unit which compares the two inputs
and writes the minimum value to the min output and the maximum value to
the max output. Assume all values are encoded as unsigned binary numbers.
