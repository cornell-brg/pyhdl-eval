Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0 (8 bits)
 - input  in1 (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement a subtractor which subtracts in1 from in0 and
writes the result to the output. Assume all values are encoded as two's
complement binary numbers.
