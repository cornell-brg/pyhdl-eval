Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (100 bits)
 - output out (  7 bits)

The module should implement a popcount unit which calculates the
population count (i.e., the number of ones) of the input and writes the
result to the output.
