Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  en
 - input  ld
 - input  pin (8 bits)
 - output sout

The module should implement an 8-bit, parallel-input, serial-output shift
register with an active-high synchronous reset and an enable. When the
input ld is high (regardless of the value of the input en), then the
parallel input (pin) should be loaded into the shift register. When the
input en is high, then the shift register should shift all of its values
by one bit to the left and shift a zero into the least-significant bit of
the shift register. The most-significant bit of the shift register should
be connected to the output sout. The shift register should be reset to
zero when the reset input is one. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
