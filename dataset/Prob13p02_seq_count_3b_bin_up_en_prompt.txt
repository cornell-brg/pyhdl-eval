Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  en
 - output out (3 bits)

The module should implement a 3-bit binary up counter with an active-high
synchronous reset and an enable. The counter should be reset to zero when
the reset input is one. The counter should then count up by one every
cycle as long as the input en is one; when the counter reaches the
maximum value it should wrap-around. The internal counter register should
be directly connected to the output port. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
