Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - output out

The module should implement the following circuit: input in0 should be
connected to a D flip-flop (let's call this DFF0); input in1 should be
connected to a second D flip-flop (let's call this DFF1); input in2
should be connected to a third D flip-flop (let's call this DFF2); the
outputs of DFF0 an DFF1 should be connected to a two-input XOR gate; the
output of the XOR gate should be conneectd to a NOT gate; the output of
the NOT gate should be connected to the first input of a two-input AND
gate; the output of DFF2 should be connected to the second input of the
two-input AND gate; the output of the AND gate should be connected to the
output port. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive
edge of the clock.
