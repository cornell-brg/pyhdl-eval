Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  en
 - input  d (8 bits)
 - output q (8 bits)

The module should implement eight D flip-flops with an active-high
synchronous reset and an enable. The internal state should be reset to
the value 0xff when the reset input is one. The input should only be
sampled when the enable (en) input is one. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
