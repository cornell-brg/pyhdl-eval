Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (100 bits)
 - output out (100 bits)

The module implementation should connect the input port to the output
port but with the bits in reversed order. In other words, in_[0] should
be connected to out[99], in_[1] should be connected to out[98], and so on.
