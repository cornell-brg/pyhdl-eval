In this problem, you will be implementing a hardware module named
TopModule that combinationally wires input ports to output ports.

The module should provide the following interface. All input and output
ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module implementation should directly connect the input port to the
output port.
