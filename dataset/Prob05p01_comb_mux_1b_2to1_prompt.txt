Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - input  sel
 - output out

The module should implement a 1-bit 2-to-1 multiplexer. The input sel
should select which of the two inputs is used to write the output. If sel
equals 0 then in0 should be selected and if sel equals 1 then then in1
should be selected.
