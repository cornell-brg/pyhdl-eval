Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output f

The module should implement a combinational circuit described by the
following Karnaugh map. Note that a is the column variable and b is the
row variable.

   b\a | 0 1
  -----+-----
    0  | 1 1
    1  | 1 0
