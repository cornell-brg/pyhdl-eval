I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  d (8 bits)
 - output q (8 bits)

Implement a module that includes 8 D flip-flops. All DFFs should be
triggered by the negative edge of clk.

The module includes an active-high synchronous reset signal; this means
the reset is sampled with respect to the clock, so do not include posedge
reset in the sensitivity list of any sequential always block. The reset
signal should reset the counter to 0x34 rather than zero.
