Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  a
 - output f

The module should implement a sequential circuit with a single bit of
state described by the following simulation waveform. The waveform shows
the input values and the desired output values on every cycle of the
simulation. An X indicates that the output is undefined because there is
no reset signal for this sequential circuit.
