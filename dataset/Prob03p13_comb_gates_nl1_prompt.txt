Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - input  in3
 - output out

The module should implement the following circuit: input in0 should be
connected to a NOT gate and the output of this NOT gate should be
connected to the first input of a two-input OR gate; input in1 should be
connected to the second input of this two-input OR gate; input in2 should
be connected to the first input of another two-input OR gate; input in3
should be connected to a NOT gate and the output of this NOT gate should
be connected to the second input of the two-input OR gate; the output of
both two-input OR gates should be connected to a two-input AND gate; the
output of the AND gate should be connected to the output port.
