Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - output lo
 - output hi

The module implementation should always output a logic LOW and a logic
HIGH on the appropriate output ports. A logic LOW should always be output
on output port lo and a logic HIGH should always be output on output port
hi.
