Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0 (8 bits)
 - input  in1 (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)
 - output overflow

The module should implement an unsigned fixed-point multiplier which
multiplies the two given inputs and writes the result to the output.
Assume all values are encoded as UQ4.4 fixed point (i.e., the most
significant four bits represent the integer part and the least
significant four bits represent the fraction part). Because the output is
only 8 bits there is a chance of overflow (the full-precision output is
too large to represent using UQ4.4). In the case of overflow, set the
overflow signal high and the output to zero.
