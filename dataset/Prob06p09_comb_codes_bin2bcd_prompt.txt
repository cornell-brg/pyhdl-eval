Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (4 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should convert a 4-bit binary encoded value into a 2-digit
natural binary coded decimal (BCD) value. In an natural BCD encoding
(also called an 8421 encoding), each decimal digital is represented by it
corresponding 4-bit binary value.
