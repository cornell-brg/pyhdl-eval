Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (64 bits)
 - output out (64 bits)

The module implementation should connect the input port to the output
port but with the bytes in reversed order. In other words, the least
significant byte of the input should be written to the most significant
byte of the output, the most significant byte of the input should be
written to the least significant byte of the output, and so on.
