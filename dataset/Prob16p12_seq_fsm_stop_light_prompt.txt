Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  starting_yellow
 - input  change
 - output green_on
 - output yellow_on
 - output red_on

The module should implement a Moore finite-state machine (FSM) for a
traffic light controller with an active-high synchronous reset. The three
outputs are used to turn on one of the three traffic lights. Only one
light should be on at a time. The FSM should reset to the state which
turns on the green light. The input change is used to move between the
states of the FSM in one of two orders depending on whether the input
starting_yellow is high or low. If starting_yellow is high, then the FSM
should change from green, to yellow, to red, to yellow, and back to
green. If starting_yellow is low, then the FSM should change from green,
to yellow, to red, and back to green. Assume that the starting_yellow
signal will only switch when the traffic light is in the state which
turns on the green light. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the
positive edge of the clock.
