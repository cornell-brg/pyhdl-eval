Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0 (8 bits)
 - input  in1 (8 bits)
 - input  cin
 - output out (8 bits)
 - output cout

The module should implement an adder which adds the two given inputs and
writes the result to the output. The adder should also include the carry
input (i.e., the cin port) as part of the addition, and should write the
final carry output to the cout port. Assume all values are encoded as
two's complement binary numbers.
