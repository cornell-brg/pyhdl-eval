Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_
 - input  sel (  7 bits)
 - output out (128 bits)

The module should implement a 1-bit 1-to-128. The input sel
should select which bit of the output is written with the value of the
input port in_. Unselected output bits should be set to zero. If sel
equals 0 then bit 0 of out should be selected, if sel equals 1 then bit 1
of out should be selected, and so on.
