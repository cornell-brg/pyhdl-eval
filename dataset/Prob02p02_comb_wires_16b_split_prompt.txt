Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output lo  (4 bits)
 - output hi  (4 bits)

The module implementation should split the input into two four-bit
fields. The least-significant four bits (i.e., in_[3:0]) should be
connected to the output lo port, while the most-significant four bits
(i.e., in_[7:4]) should be connected to the output hi port.
