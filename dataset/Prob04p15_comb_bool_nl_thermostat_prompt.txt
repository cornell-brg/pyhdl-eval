Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  mode
 - input  too_cold
 - input  too_hot
 - input  fan_on
 - output heater
 - output aircon
 - output fan

The module should implement a heating/cooling thermostat controller which
controls a heater (during the winter), an air conditioner (during the
summer), and a blower fan (during both the winter and summer). The
thermostat can be in one of two modes: heating mode (mode = 1) or cooling
model (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the heater on when it is too cold
(too_cold = 1) but do not use the air conditioner. In cooling mode, turn
the air conditioner on when it is too hot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn
on the heater. When the heater or air conditioner are on, also turn on
the blower fan to circulate the air. In addition, the user can also
request the fan to turn on (fan_on = 1), even if the heater and air
conditioner are off.
