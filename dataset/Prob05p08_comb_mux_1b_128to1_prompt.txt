Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (128 bits)
 - input  sel (  7 bits)
 - output out

The module should implement a 1-bit 128-to-1 multiplexer. The input sel
should select which bit of the input in_ is used to write the output. If
sel equals 0 then bit 0 of in_ should be selected, if sel equals 1 then
bit 1 of in_ should be selected, and so on.
