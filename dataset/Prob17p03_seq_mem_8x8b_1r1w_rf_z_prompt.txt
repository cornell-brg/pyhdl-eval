Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  read_addr  (3 bits)
 - output read_data  (8 bits)
 - input  write_en
 - input  write_addr (3 bits)
 - input  write_data (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-entry 8-bit register file with one read
port and one write port. The read port should be combinational (i.e., the
read data corresponds to the input read address on that cycle) and writes
should only occur when the write enable is high. The register file should
always read the value currently stored in the register file even if the
write address equals the read address. The register file should treat
register zero specially; reading register zero should always return the
value zero. Writing register zero is valid but should have no observable
effect. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.
