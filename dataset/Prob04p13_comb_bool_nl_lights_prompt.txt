Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  dark
 - input  movement
 - input  force_on
 - output turn_on_lights

The module should implement a controller for a home lighting system.
There are three inputs: input dark is one if it is dark outside and zero
if it is light outside; input movement is one if the security system has
detected movement and is otherwise zero; and input force_on is one if a
manual override switch is activated. The lights should be turned on if it
is dark outside and the security system has detected movement. The lights
should always be turned off if it is light outside regardless of whether
the security system has detected movement. The lights should always be
turned on if the manual override switch is activated.
