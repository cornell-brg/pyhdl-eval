Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  vibrate_mode
 - input  ring
 - output turn_on_ringer
 - output turn_on_motor

The module should implement a circuit to control a cellphone's ringer and
vibration motor. Whenever the phone needs to ring from an incoming call
(i.e., input ring is one), the circuit must either turn on the ringer
(i.e., set the turn_on_ringer output to one) or the vibration motor
(i.e., set the turn_on_motor output to one), but not both. If the phone
is in vibrate mode (i.e., input vibrate_mode is one), turn on the motor.
Otherwise, turn on the ringer.
