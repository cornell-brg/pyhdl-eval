Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in_
 - output state (4 bits)
 - output out

The module should implement a Moore finite-state machine (FSM) described
by the following table.

   Current | Next State  Next State |
   State   | if in_=0    if in_=1   | Output
  ---------+------------------------+--------
      A    |     A           B      |   0
      B    |     C           B      |   0
      C    |     A           D      |   0
      D    |     C           B      |   1

The state machine should use the following one-hot state encoding.

 - A : 0b0001
 - B : 0b0010
 - C : 0b0100
 - D : 0b1000

The FSM should reset to state A when the reset input is one. The internal
state register should be directly connected to the output port state so
that this output always reflects the current state of the FSM. Assume all
sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
