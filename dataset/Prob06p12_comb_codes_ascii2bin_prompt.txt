Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (16 bits)
 - output out ( 4 bits)

The module should convert a 2-digit ASCII encoded value (using a decimal
representation) to a 4-bit binary encoded value. For example, if the
input is "02" then the output should be 0b0010 and if the input is "10"
then the output should be 0b1000. If the input value cannot be
represented as a 4-bit binary encoded value then the output should be set
to zero.
