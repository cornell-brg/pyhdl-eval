Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  a
 - input  b
 - output q

The module should implement a sequential circuit triggered by the
positive edge of the clock. The module is described by the following
truth table where q indicates the previous value of the state holding
element before the rising edge of the clock and q_next indicates the next
value of the state holding element after the rising edge of the clock.

   a b q_prev | q_next
