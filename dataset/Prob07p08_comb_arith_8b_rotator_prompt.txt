Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - input  amt (3 bits)
 - input  op
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement a variable rotator which takes as input a
value to rotate (in_) and the rotation amount (amt) and writes the
rotated result to the output (out). The input op specifies what kind of
rotate to perform using the following encoding:

 - 0 : rotate left
 - 1 : rotate right
