Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0 ( 8 bits)
 - input  in1 ( 8 bits)
 - output lt
 - output eq
 - output gt

The module should implement a signed comparator which compares the two
given inputs and updates all three outputs as follows:

 - lt should be one if in0 is less than in1
 - eq should be one if in0 is equal to in1
 - gt should be one if in0 is greater than in1

Assume all values are encoded as two's complement binary numbers.
