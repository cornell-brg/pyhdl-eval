Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  state      (2 bits)
 - input  in_
 - output state_next (2 bits)
 - output out

The module should implement the state transition and output logic for the
Mealy finite-state machine (FSM) described by the following table. Each
next state entry in the table is of the format X/Y where X is the next
state and Y is the output.

   Current |  Next State/Output
   State   | if in_=0    if in_=1
  ---------+----------------------
      A    |   A/0         B/1
      B    |   C/1         B/0
      C    |   A/0         D/1
      D    |   C/0         B/0

The state machine should use the following state encoding.

 - A : 0
 - B : 1
 - C : 2
 - D : 3

The module should only implement the combinational state transition logic
and output logic and should not include any sequential state.
