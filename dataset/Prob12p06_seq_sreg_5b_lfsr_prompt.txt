Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output out (5 bits)

The module should implement a 5-bit maximum-length Galios linear feedback
shift register (LFSR) with an active-high synchronous reset.

We can represent a 5-bit standard shift register which shifts bits to the
right as follows:

  in --> S[4] --> S[3] --> S[2] --> S[1] --> S[0] --> out

S[i] refers to the ith flip-flop in the shift register, where i ranges
from 0 to 4 inclusive. A Galois LFSR is a shift register with two-input
XOR gates inserted between specific bits of the shift register; the
output of the shift register is connected to the free input of each XOR
gate. If the XOR gates are inserted carefully, the LFSR can be made to be
"maximum-length". A maximum-length LFSR of n bits cycles through 2**n-1
states before repeating (the all-zero state is never reached).

The module should implement the following 5-bit maximal-length Galois
LFSR where a single XOR gate is inserted between S[2] and S[3].

  .--> S[4] --> S[3] --> XOR --> S[2] --> S[1] --> S[0] --.
  |                       ^                               |
  '-----------------------'-------------------------------'

All five bits of the shift register should be connected to the output.
The module's internal shift register should be reset to binary one (i.e.,
S[0] should be reset to one while the remaining bits should be reset to
zero) one when the reset input is one. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
