Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  op
 - output out (3 bits)

The module should implement a 3-bit binary up/down counter with an
active-high synchronous reset. The counter should be reset to zero when
the reset input is one. The counter should then count either up or down
by one every cycle; when the counter reaches either zero or the maximum
value it should wrap-around. The input op specifies whether to count up
or down using the following encoding:

 - 0 : count up
 - 1 : count down

The internal counter register should be directly connected to the output
port. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.
