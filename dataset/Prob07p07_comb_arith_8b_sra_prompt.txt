Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - input  amt (3 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement a variable right arithmetic shifter which
takes as input a value to shift (in_) and the shift amount (amt) and
writes the shifted result to the output (out).
