Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (4 bits)

The module should convert a 2-digit natural binary coded decimal (BCD)
value to a 4-bit binary encoded value. In an natural BCD encoding (also
called an 8421 encoding), each decimal digital is represented by it
corresponding 4-bit binary value. If the input is an invalid BCD encoding
then the output should be zero. If the BCD encoded value cannot be
represented using a 4-bit binary encoded value then the output should be
zero.
