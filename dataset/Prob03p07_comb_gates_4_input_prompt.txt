Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0
 - input  in1
 - input  in2
 - input  in3
 - output out_and
 - output out_nand
 - output out_or
 - output out_nor

The module should implement four logic gates: a four-input AND gate, a
four-input NAND gate, a four-input OR gate, and a four-input NOR gate.
The output of each gate should be connected to the appropriate output
port.
