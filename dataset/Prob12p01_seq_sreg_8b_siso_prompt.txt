Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  en
 - input  sin
 - output sout

The module should implement an 8-bit, serial-input, serial-output shift
register with an active-high synchronous reset and an enable. When the
input en is high, then the shift register should shift all of its values
by one bit to the left and use the input sin as the new least-significant
bit of the shift register. The most-significant bit of the shift register
should connected to the output sout. The shift register should be reset
to zero when the reset input is one. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.
