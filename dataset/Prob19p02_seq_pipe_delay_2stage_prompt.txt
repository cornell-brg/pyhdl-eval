Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement a two-stage pipelined channel where the input
data is passed unchanged through two stages of pipeline registers. Here
is an example execution trace. An X indicates that the output is
undefined because there is no reset signal for the pipeline registers.

   cycle | in_ out
  -------+---------
     0   | 00  XX
     1   | 0a  XX
     2   | 0b  00
     3   | 0c  0a
     4   | 0d  0b
     5   | 0e  0c
     6   | 0f  0d
     7   | 00  0e
     8   | 00  0f

Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.
