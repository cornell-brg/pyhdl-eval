Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in0  (3 bits)
 - input  in1  (3 bits)
 - input  in2  (3 bits)
 - input  in3  (3 bits)
 - input  in4  (3 bits)
 - output out0 (4 bits)
 - output out1 (4 bits)
 - output out2 (4 bits)
 - output out3 (4 bits)

The module implementation should concatenate the input ports together
into a single wide signal, and then split this wide signal across the
output ports. The input port in0 should be connected to the
least-significant three bits of output port out0, the input port in1
should be split across output ports out0 and out1, the input port in2
should be split across output ports out1 and out2, and so on. There are
five 3-bit input ports for a total of 15 bits, and there are four 4-bit
output ports for a total of 16 bits. So there is one more bit in the
output compared to the input. Wire the most significant bit of output
port out3 to be a constant logic one.
