I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  resetn
 - input  in
 - output out

The module should implement a shift register with four D flops.

The module includes an active-low synchronous resetn signal; this means
the resetn is sampled with respect to the clock, so do not include
posedge resetn in the sensitivity list of any sequential always block.
