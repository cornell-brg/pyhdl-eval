I would like you to implement a module named TopModule with the following
interface. All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise
specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - output q (32 bits)

A linear feedback shift register is a shift register usually with a few
XOR gates to produce the next state of the shift register. A Galois LFSR
is one particular arrangement where bit positions with a "tap" are XORed
with the output bit to produce each bit's next value, while bit positions
without a tap shift.

The module should implement a 32-bit Galois LFSR with taps at bit
positions 32, 22, 2, and 1. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on
the positive edge of the clock.

The module includes an active-high synchronous reset signal; this means
the reset is sampled with respect to the clock, so do not include posedge
reset in the sensitivity list of any sequential always block. The reset
signal should reset the output q to 32'h1.
