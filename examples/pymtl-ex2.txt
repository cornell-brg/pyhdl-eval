Question:
Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer with an
active-high synchronous reset. The 8-bit input is first registered and
then incremented by one on the next cycle. The internal state should be
reset to zero when the reset input is one. Assume all values are encoded
as two's complement binary numbers. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Enclose your code with <CODE> and </CODE>. Only output the code snippet
and do NOT output anything else.

Answer:
<CODE>
from pymtl3 import *

class TopModule( Component ):

  def construct( s ):

    # Port-based interface

    s.in_ = InPort ( Bits8 )
    s.out = OutPort( Bits8 )

    # Sequential logic

    s.reg_out = Wire( Bits8 )

    @update_ff
    def block1():
      if s.reset:
        s.reg_out <<= 0
      else:
        s.reg_out <<= s.in_

    # Combinational logic

    s.temp_wire = Wire( Bits8 )

    @update
    def block2():
      s.temp_wire @= s.reg_out + 1

    # Structural connections

    s.out //= s.temp_wire
</CODE>
