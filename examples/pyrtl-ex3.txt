Question:
Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - parameter nbits
 - input     clk
 - input     reset
 - input     in_ (nbits)
 - output    out (nbits)

The module should implement an N-bit registered incrementer with an
active-high synchronous reset. The bitwidth is specified by the parameter
nbits. The N-bit input is first registered and then incremented by one on
the next cycle. The internal state should be reset to zero when the reset
input is one. Assume all values are encoded as two's complement binary
numbers. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of
the clock.

Enclose your code with <CODE> and </CODE>. Only output the code snippet
and do NOT output anything else.

Answer:
<CODE>
from pyrtl import *

def TopModule( in_, nbits ):

  # Declare outputs

  out = WireVector( nbits )

  # Sequential logic

  reg_out = Register( nbits, reset_value=0 )
  reg_out.next <<= in_

  # Combinational logic

  temp_wire = WireVector( nbits )
  temp_wire <<= reg_out + 1

  # Structural connections

  out <<= temp_wire

  # Return outputs

  return out
</CODE>
