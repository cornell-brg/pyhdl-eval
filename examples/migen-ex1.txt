Question:
Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an incrementer which increments the input by
one and writes the result to the output. Assume all values are encoded as
two's complement binary numbers.

Enclose your code with <CODE> and </CODE>. Only output the code snippet
and do NOT output anything else.

Answer:
<CODE>
from migen import *

class TopModule( Module ):

  def __init__( s ):

    # Port-based interface

    s.in_ = Signal(8)
    s.out = Signal(8)

    # Combinational logic

    s.comb += s.out.eq( s.in_ + 1 )
</CODE>
