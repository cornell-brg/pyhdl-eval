Question:
Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input     clk
 - input     en
 - input     ld
 - input     in_ (8 bits)
 - output    out (8 bits)

The module should implement an N-bit counting registered incrementer with
an enable. When the input ld is high (regardless of the value of the
input en), then the input (in_) should be loaded into an internal
register. When the input en is high, then the module should increment the
internal register by one. The internal register should always be
connected to the output regardless of whether the module is enabled or
not. Assume all sequential logic is triggered on the positive edge of the
clock.

Answer:
<CODE>
from pyrtl import *

def TopModule( en, ld, in_ ):

  # Declare outputs

  out = WireVector(8)

  # Sequential logic

  reg_next = WireVector(8)
  reg_out  = Register(8)

  with conditional_assignment:
    with ld:
      reg_out.next |= in_
    with en:
      reg_out.next |= reg_next

  # Combinational logic

  reg_next <<= reg_out + 1

  # Structural connections

  out <<= reg_out

  # Return outputs

  return out
</CODE>
