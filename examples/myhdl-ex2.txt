Question:
Implement a hardware module named TopModule with the following interface.
All input and output ports are one bit unless otherwise specified.

 - input  clk
 - input  reset
 - input  in_ (8 bits)
 - output out (8 bits)

The module should implement an 8-bit registered incrementer with an
active-high synchronous reset. The 8-bit input is first registered and
then incremented by one on the next cycle. The internal state should be
reset to zero when the reset input is one. Assume all values are encoded
as two's complement binary numbers. Assume all sequential logic is
triggered on the positive edge of the clock.

Enclose your code with <CODE> and </CODE>. Only output the code snippet
and do NOT output anything else.

Answer:
<CODE>
from myhdl import *

@block
def TopModule( clk, reset, in_, out ):

  # Sequential logic

  reg_out = Signal( modbv(0)[8:] )

  @always( clk.posedge )
  def seq():
    if reset:
      reg_out.next = 0
    else:
      reg_out.next = in_

  # Combinational logic

  temp_wire = Signal( modbv(0)[8:] )

  @always_comb
  def comb0():
    temp_wire.next = reg_out + 1

  # Structural connections

  @always_comb
  def comb1():
    out.next = temp_wire

  # Return blocks

  return seq, comb0, comb1
</CODE>
